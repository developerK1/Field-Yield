This sample use lots of state handling and it is so chalenging

The idea of making function to do specific one thing, is very important ..

The part that really challenged me ont his project is storing data on local storage as and array. The problem was that it doestn't have
"id's" (unique identifiers) which became a problem when I have to delete it...

The project reminded me of why React
Easy state management using State and IDs using "Keys"
